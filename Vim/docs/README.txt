= Contributors Guide =

* Pedagogy is the most important aspect of this guide:
  **Explaining less is more**. Users will follow their own path and
  find whatever suits their needs.
  
* If you want to add anything, make sure it replaces or improves
  something already written without making the text too long or
  tedious.  Try not to use obscure commands or difficult
  abbreviations.

* If you think you found an error, try to discuss first on the home
  page so that you get access to modify the document if there is
  consensus among translators and writers.

* The section "Crazy Action Commands" may be expanded indefinitely,
  provided all commands are actually crazy and they offer the kind
  of action only Vim and Hollywood movies have to offer.

* Try to improve the use of the language (make it friendly yet
  elegant in the literary aspect, as this guide was not originally
  written by native English speakers) Also, keep the current visual
  format for the text.

* Take care of the language the most you can. Try to keep it
  neutral by avoiding regionalisms
  (i.e., Brit. meagre / Amer. meager)
