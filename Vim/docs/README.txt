= Contributors Guide =

* Pedagogy is the most important aspect of this guide:
  **Explaining less is more**. Users will follow their own path and
  find whatever suits their needs.
  
* Try not to use obscure commands or difficult abbreviations if
  they are not really needed:
  
  Vim has two strong points, avoids abusing the rat (mouse) and
  absurd key combinations (i.e., Richard Stallman, Emacs creator
  has RSI)  This guide must encourage or force the user -if you
  will- to understand the keyboard much better than just learning
  Vim.  Please don't suggest absurd key-combos i.e., those used by
  default in Emacs.
  
* If you think you found an error try to discuss it first on the
  home page, then help correct it.

*NOTES:*
* The section "Crazy Action Commands" may be expanded indefinitely,
  provided all commands are actually crazy and they offer the kind
  of action only Vim and Hollywood movies have to offer.

* Try to improve the use of the language (make it friendly yet
  elegant in the literary aspect, as this guide was not originally
  written by native English speakers)  Also, keep the current
  visual format for the text.

* Take care of the language the most you can. Try to keep it
  neutral by avoiding regionalisms
  (i.e., Brit. meagre / Amer.  meager)
