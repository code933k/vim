== INTRODUCTION ==

If there is coffee, tea or some aromatic spices at hand
this is the right moment to get a hot cup.  I'll begin with
the context, augmenting progressively the technical degree
of this text until we get to the matter and -hopefully-
leave you with enough knowledge about Vim from A to Z.

Is that cup already there?

Let us begin the path to Enlightenment!


== A BRIEF AND HOPEFULLY NOT SO BORING HISTORICAL ==

I guess you already know about the so called "text editor
holy wars", the holy wars between Vim and Emacs. I'll
sum it up for you:  Many people thought we are more
productive by moving our hands the less possible from
keyboard's home row position.

*HOME ROW:*
* US keyboard: _ASDF - JKL;_
* Latin keyboard: _ASDF - JKLÑ_

Solutions were crystal clear: Kill the mouse!! `:O~`

    Many actions commonly associated with the rat, if not
    all of them, may be replaced much more expressively and
    powerfully with the keyboard.
    
    The problem is: How to do that the best way possible?

That is the reason behind Vim's motion keys `H-J-K-L`:

    * `h`: Left
    * `j`: Down
    * `k`: Up
    * `l`: Right

Quite intuitive, by the way, and as HOME ROWy as anything
can get. This avoids you to lower your hands to the arrow
keys; those are useless unless you *bind* them (reassign on
the map of functions) to perform another set of actions
instead of just moving the cursor around the text.

This fact alone converts Vim in an editor quite fluid and
powerful.

    *KEY EXPRESSIONS:*
        * Less is more: Comes from Unix philosophy. If you
          take a few things which perform specific actions
          and combine them, they become almost endlessly
          powerful. Vim integrates quite well with the whole
          system to achieve incredible results.
          
        * Kill the rat: Using the rat (mouse) is generally
          counterproductive and stresses your wrists,
          producing RSI (repetitive strain injury) equally
          or much more than people with bad hand posture or
          bad key-typing itself.
          
        * HOME ROW: Keeping hands in the base position of
          the keyboard to achieve better resting, speed and
          effectiveness.
          
        * I love you guys -- Eric Cartman


=== Second Part ===

Many text editors are directly derived from editors of more
traditional Unix times (times where rats didn't swarm among
computers because of the evil Mac and M$)

    * VI was the begotten son of venerable `ed`
    * `sed` is his direct descendant (GNU ed version,
      stream editor that you still find in modern Unix
      variants and Unix-like systems.  It is pretty
      recommended for fast edition of text in mass (i.e.,
      many text files at a time)
    * `tr` may be considered a simple `sed` version, is also
      currently available in all Unix-like systems: BSD and
      its multiple descendants, Linux distributions,
      etcetera. 
    * From `vi`, the most relevant descendants are `elvis`
      and `vim`. Yeah! Elvis. You know, the guy from mars
      who never died.


Historically speaking, RMS,
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_stallman|Richard Stallman]]
thinks VI and Vim are just `ed` hacks to make it look more user
friendly.  Emacs (his creation) on the other hand, appears the
cure for all evils.

Some of us think quite different:

Emacs compels many people because it is the flag editor of
GNU software -as creation of RMS- and given its internal
power (because it was written in Lisp which is a powerful
scripted language) its style and accessibility.

If you have used the terminal multiplexor _screen_, you
already know `Ctrl+A` is the predefined "escape" key for
commands. I mean, every time you press `CTRL+A`, a command
is sent to the _screen_ interpreter instead of the terminal
_terminal_ directly.

Thus, Emacs differentiates between commands or instructions
for itself and instructions intended to format text.
i.e., `C-x C-b`, `C-c`, `M-x`, etcetera.

    * ESCAPE: In programming it is anything employed to
      break a modality of operation, going from one mode to
      another (i.e., comments inside a program source code
      must be marked or "escaped" so that the interpreter or
      compiler does not read them as usual code).

Just like Emacs works under the paradigm of _modal keys_
-the same way that `CTRL+A` use to work on _screen_- and
other programs) many of their users do not fully comprehend
the pleasure we experiment when using Vim.


=== The Big Secret ===

Now that you conquered the phase of initiation, I'll tell
you why they do not understand: Vim is all about
_expression_ not mnemonic techniques. For the most part, the
important thing are gestures, not commands themselves.

For example, for saving text to your hard drive, it is
important that you remember to issue `:wq`. Later
you won't even remember the command exactly. It will be
integrated to your muscle memory, acting just as facial
expressions.  Also, been modal, it helps you separating
functions quite neatly; just like video-games.

        VI was a program with a somewhat "unclear license"
        this is why Richard Stallman said the wise words:
        _"VI VI VI, is the editor of the devil"_.

However, Vim (Vi IMproved) is an excellent editor written
under the GNU/GPL license, with the advantages of other well
known editors and some strengths on its own.  Its few
disadvantages are usually solved quite simply unlike others.

Example: (Reference System: openSUSE 11.3) 

| Editor     | Installed Size | Extensions and config | Total   |
|------------+----------------+-----------------------+---------|
| vim        | 1.8 MiB        | 8.2 MiB               | 10  MiB |
| emacs      | 53.5 MiB       | - undetermined -      | 54  MiB |
| ooo-writer | 198.2 MiB      | - undetermined -      | 200 MiB |

If there is no graphic mode (Xorg server on Linux and BSD)
or there is some M$ alike general error by a strike of bad
fortune, how do you get to solve that kind of problem in 
Emacs, Eclipse, M$ Word, or notepad ?  A simple editor like
nano is kind of useful in that situations but, do you think
it really has the advantages and edition speed of Vim?

*NOTE:* Emacs interface sometimes produces flickering errors
with many open video card drivers.  Poetic justice? LOL!

I don't really know how much expertise you have with Vim,
but her we go anyway :D


== EXPRESSIONS IN VIM ==

=== Movement ===

Now you know that `h` is much faster for moving to
the left, `j` to move down one line, `k` for moving up one
or more lines and `l` for moving to the right.

Now you know what you can achieve by *breaking the
paradigm*: Vim is a multimodal editor. It means it works in
_normal mode_ (or commands) _insert(ion) mode_ and _visual
mode_ or kill the rat :)

By pressing `<ESC>` or `<CTRL+C>` you enter _normal mode_.
Remember you can do the same with `<CTRL+[>` in *nix
environments just if it's more comfortable to you.

    * Normal mode is the mode of editor commands `<ESC>`
    * Isertion mode `i` (faster) or `<INS>` (insert)
    * Visual mode `v` o `V` (even `<CTRL+V>`)
     
    Using arbitrary key combinations as `CTRL+C` for copying
    and `CTRL+V` for pasting is not necessary in Vim, no
    matter if you can actually change key-maps as far as
    you see fit. I -personally- don't recommend you do that,
    for humanity invented `<CTRL+V>` to suit more civilized
    costumes:
    
    Pressing `v` in normal mode starts a text selection by
    characters (moving around with `h-j-k-l`).
    
    If you want to *indent* text (tabulate, move to the
    right), just press `>` as much as you need; and `<` to
    achieve the opposite effect.
    
    If you want to copy your selection: `y` (yank) is what
    you were looking for.  After pressing `y`, Vim
    will leave you in _normal_ mode once again, so you can
    move with  `h-j-k-l` "normally" to the line of text
    where you want to paste those contents. Thus, `p` is the
    key you need to finish the job of "pasting" text.
    
    See? Now you are editing faster than you used to in any
    icon based bloat!
    
    With `Y` (capital Y) your selection isn't copied
    privately, I mean, only for the text buffers (portions
    of the file loaded into memory) you are currently
    working on. Instead, you can copy and paste into another
    terminal by issuing: `<Shift+INSERT>`
    
    *NOTE _2a_* There is an important detail here. What to
    do for copying text from external sources? (i.e., from
    you web browser to Vim) Simple! Use:
    
    * `:set paste`
    * `:set nopaste`
    
    `set paste` ensures that the text is kept with the
    original format or one next to the original. Spaces
    tabs, and other details are preserved as far as
    possible. `set no paste` returns to Vim automatic
    indentation (i.e., for programming)
    
    In fact, when you get more experience, you'll find out
    that there are many ways of entering insertion and
    visual modes. The text below is just for information,
    you don't need to remember this right now.
    
    I will always assume you are in normal mode `<ESC>`:
    For example, if the cursor is positioned in the middle
    of a word and you press `i` insert mode is started right
    in the current position of the cursor.  Pressing `o`,
    Vim begins editing one line below. `O`, which is `o`
    negated, puts you in insertion mode but now one line
    above.  Pressing `a` (append) you'll begin after the
    character where the cursor was placed before. `A` begins
    after the end of the line, etcetera.

    Inf visual mode occurs something similar: `V` (capital
    v), does not enter _visual mode_ or selection per
    character but per paragraph.  Quite mnemonic if you
    think of `<Shift>` as the command used in computation
    for boosting or negating commands.  In this case,
    `<Shift+v>` boosts or elongates our character selection
    to paragraphs.
    
    Finally, to move all the way up to the beginning of the
    text, press `gg`. And `G` to move all the way down to
    the end.  Moving to the beginning or the end of any
    paragraph, use regex (regular expressions, just like
    Perl programming standards) mnemonics:
    `$`, moves to the end. `0` to the first character of the
    paragraph or `^` to the first blank before the line.
    To move between words, `w`.  Thus, `dw` "may be
    understood" as "delete word".  And so forth.
    
    I forgot to say:  Undo is `u` (really? yes!) and re-do
   `<CTRL+R>` by default.  But you also can create a new map
   into  ~/.vimrc: `map r <C-R>` to use re-do in normal mode
   just by pressing the letter `r`, any way you feel
   the most comfortable.  Vim has multilevel undo. Last
   versions have even an undo history -the bastard!
   
   Bear in mind that `r` is replace by default, which is
   more convenient than the mapping above. You see, it
   replaces the character under the cursor in normal mode.
   (`rr` over _o_at, converts oat to rat)


=== Normal Mode ===

I don't find so much to add to our normal mode lesson, now
you know how to move around and save text in this mode.

A key to save even faster is `ZZ`. Which is just an
expressive map to the command `:wq!`. Notice the exclamation
mark at the end of `:wq`, meaning "it is imperative". So
**all** changes are saved and Vim exits without asking;
unless your file has no name. If you entered Vim just by
issuing `$ vim` into the terminal command line, instead of 
`$ vim file_name`, the editor will warn you
`E32: No File Name`.

`:wq` then, is simmilar to `:wqa` Write-(and)-Quit-All (All,
is for all documents currently open)

`WW` helps saving the same way as `:w!` which is "save the
buffer (current session) without exiting Vim.

Finally, for copying, pasting and cutting at light-speed,
here I offer some of my *TIPS*. Which I hope you know by
now:

`dd` Delete line, and then `p` is useful to cut and paste one
line faster than any editor I know. `D` deletes (cuts) from
the actual position of the cursor.

*NOTE:*
Now you know the concepts are different than any other
editor you have used before, it isn't just about the names
of the commands.  This is because Vim just like `ed` is a
text editor based on streams (data flux in a buffer or
memory allocation) so, quite different from bloated garbage
like M$ Word, you don't have to ask: "Save my work
every 5 minutes".  Your text is readily saved to the last
letter in case of electrical interruption, eventual system
failure or human error.

This backup files are automatically saved as hidden
`.file_name.swp` (swap) and not intended to be edited
by hand because they are binary diff (telling apart the
differences between versions) of the original file.

If you use `set backup` in `~/.vimrc` the editor will take
the extra step of saving a file with the data you had before
saving new data to the file. For example, _my_file.txt_ will
create a copy of the original named _my_file.txt~_

That is an option I love, but many people prefers:
`set nobackup` to avoid a lot of files ended in `~` lurking
around their disks. I chose avoiding accidents and
convenient backups through a system process which removes 7
days old backup files.

=== Addendum: Command Line (CLI) ===

For editing many files at a time in Vim, you have two
options at least (you know there's always something more :))

`vim -p file1 file2 file3 ..`
Which opens those three files in tabs the way Mozilla
Firefox does for browsing the web. *-O* makes possible
opening them in frames along the same screen.

`vim -o file1 file2 file3 ..`
Does so horizontally

`vim -O file1 file2 file3 ..`
With caps (shift, negating at this time) will do vertically.

Now well, if you have open something like this:

| A | B |
|---+---|
| C | D |

This is, opening 4 frames with `$ vim -o` or `$vim -O` you
can move between frames with `<CTRL+w>` + the directional
key equivalent to the direction you want to move to.

Example: The route from A to C is `CTRL+w` (wrap around) +
`j` which is the key to move downwards. From C to B you
should use `CTRL+w` + `k` `CTRL+w` + `l` (moving upwards and
then to the right).

Working with frames (misnamed "windows"; thanks Microsoft!)
you should use the same combination `CTRL+w` with `+` for
enlarging its size, and `-` for reducing it.  Your "hot" keys
are `=` for evening up their sizes and `_` to cover the
whole screen with the frame you are currently in.  This
actions are very useful when you call Vim help from any text
you are currently editing `:h`, as it pops-up another frame
in the same screen.

For moving among Tabs, you'd use `gt` to go forwards `gT`
backwards (Go Tab).  For moving among a lot of tabs, its
better to stick with `[0-9][0-9] + gt` i.e., 312gt to go to
the tab number 312 directly. This is just supposing you have
500 files open at the same time on some NASA mainframe and
you were born in mount Olympus :D

Let's say you want to open a file from inside Vim (i.e., not
from the command line) in a new tab; instead of a new frame.
As I said previously, `:tabnew path/file` and, here we go!


=== Search and Replace ===

I like a lot using an option in Vim's configuration file
`$HOME/.vimrc`: `set smartcase` It helps out ignoring the
text case when you press `/` for searching.  Thus, if you
write lowercase letters, Vim will look for lowercase and
uppercase. However if you write _CamelCase_ or _CAPS_ alike,
the editor will try to offer the exact match.

This option isn't default as the normal thing in Unix-like
systems is case sensitivity. I mean, the same words with
different capitalization are not equal to the system. And
yes, I know, that's quite racist.

I guess you did know... `?` is the same command as `/` but
the search is performed backwards. From bottom to top. This
one applies to a vast number of programs in Unix-like
systems, not just Vim. Quite standard in its way, huh?

For replacing, the most common and powerful way is to write
the command `:%s` + replacement, just like: `%s/cat/dog/g`
the last letter _g_, tells Vim we want to replace (globally)
all occurrences of cat for dog.  Not just the first entry of
dog per paragraph: `%s/cat/dog`.  Yep, I'm a dog person.

You can make a *visual selection* too (as for the most part
of the commands)  Selecting some text (you know, `v`) and
issuing `:` the symbol `:'<,'>` will appear on the command
line of Vim. It means "range".  Then, for replacing just
*inside the selection*, do `:'<,'>s/gato/perro/g`

Notice the `s` is not preceded by `%`!

An _explicit_ range (without visual selection) for replacing
all occurrences of cat for dog into the lines 1 to 5 looks
like this: `:1,5s/cat/dog/g`

There are many combinations you may learn in the long run
`:h search-replace` (help search replace) is your friend.
However, all of them are essentially the same regex (don't
you remember what it means?) used in `grep`, `sed`, `perl`,
`awk`, `C` (overall), etc.


=== Powerful options I use and kind of recall right now ===

* Talking about frames:  In normal mode you can open frames
  by issuing `:split` or `:sp` and `:vsplit` or `:vs`
  (create horizontal or vertical splits)  If are editing a
  big file you can move around two or more points of the
  same file at the same time thanks to those splits. For
  many files it works quite similarly:
  Open a frame `:vsplit` (there you have two points of the
  same file) `:e path/file2` lets you handle a second
  archive at the same time in the same screen.
  Note, `e` is for "E-dit".
  
* BookMarks: By pressing `m` + `[a-z]` (letters from a to z)
  in normal mode, a bookmark is created with that name
  (i.e., mg)  This is a register.  To come back later to the
  same line, just press a single quote `'` (works also with the
  inverted one) + the letter you previously chose. `g` in
  this example.
  
  There is an array of options, numbers `[0-9]` and, of
  course, uppercase letters `[A-Z]`. But this special
  `m`arcs -uppercase- have a special meaning: They save
  markers (bookmarks) between files.  I mean, they make
  possible jumping from the file you are editing to another
  file with the original uppercase mark.
  
  As you know, `m` is for Marks.
  
  _NOTE:_
  A single quote pressed twice will get you to a line you
  were editing previously, if you scroll around the text no
  matter if you didn't save a specific mark.
  
* Macros: Macro, is a group of instructions to execute
  sequentially.  One may specify macros in the configuration
  file `~/.vimrc` and map them to some key combinations, or
  even **recording** them in _normal mode_.  They are useful
  to avoid tedious or repetitive actions by assigning them
  directly to the editor.  
  
  Recording a macro is as simple as using bookmarks.
  Issuing: `q` + `[a-z]`, makes *record* appear into the
  lower left part of the screen (usually)  
  
  Whilst Vim is recording, any edition movements are saved
  in the register named after the letter you chose
  (i.e., `qa` saves all actions to the register "a")
  
  Recording stops after `q` is pressed.  Then, for calling
  the series of actions you want to repeat ("macro") issue:
  `@` + `[a-z]`.  In this case, it'll be exactly `@a`. When
  recording macros the important thing is creating series of
  actions so that the editor can repeat them after the next
  lines or series of characters (words).
  For more help and examples: `:h macros`

* Man: On *nix you can always get the man for most of the
  functions displayed in a C program (those man pages must
  be installed, of course...) Just press: `<Shift+k>`
  (uppercase k) over the function name or the name of the
  program you want to read about.
  
* Opening files:  In a similar fashion to `man`. You can
  open actual files too:  By issuing `gf` over ~/.vimrc
  you'll start editing your own local Vim configuration
  file. `gf` (is for go file) voilá!

  If I try to do the above right now, but didn't save the
  text in which I am currently working (read this file) Vim
  complains, letting me know it will not open another file
  until this one is saved (it is the normal behavior
  anyway).
  
* Vim saves the last line in which you are currently
  working, that is to say, every time a file is opened the
  cursor is positioned right were you where at before
  closing.

  For this to happen, your config file must have something
  like: `set viminfo='100,<50,s10,h`  which tells vim how
  much lines and how do you want them saved.  However, some
  Linux distributions (think of Debian) don't allow this by
  default.  My own ~/.vimrc looks like this to allow saving
  the cursor position:
  
{{{
    function! RecordCursor()
        " VIM TIP
        " Some GNU/Linux distros don't recall last
        " position from edited files (i.e., Debian)
        if line("'\"") <= line("$")
            normal! g`"
            return 1
        endif
    endfunction

    augroup recallPosition
        autocmd!
        autocmd BufWinEnter * call RecordCursor()
    augroup END
}}}

  
  For more on viminfo, guess what? `:h viminfo`.
  
* colorscheme(s): There are many color themes available. I
  mean, there are endless themes for any kind of freaky
  tastes out there.  Just in normal mode, press `:`
  (Vim comand) + colorscheme + `<space key>` + `<TAB>`
  (completion) which will give you an idea of the schemes
  actually installed in your system.
  
  Obviously, pressing `<ENTER>` or `<INTRO>` in European
  keyboards, Vim will try to apply the colorscheme
  immediately.  My own choices are "railscasts" and
  "ir_black" (for terminal) "liquidcarbon" and
  "martin_krischik") for GVim.  Choosing the right theme and
  configuration for your working style and eye comfort is
  more valuable than 1.000.000 hours of plain work.
  
  *NOTE*
  There are ways to enhance theme integration with the whole
  system.  Although, some color themes do not look equal in
  some terminals and not at all when compared with the GUI
  (i.e., gvim, macvim) provided the GUI has real color
  unlike most terminals, which support -generally speaking-
  from 8 to 256 colors.  From Vim, matching colors depending
  on terminal support is handled by t_Co=[16,88,256],
  respectively.
  
  For some people who does not understand how terminal color
  schemes work, configuring this is equivalent to a death
  warrant. There are many Internet guides on this topic. May
  the force be with you, because I don't like Star Wars.
  
* Plugins: Above I provide you with a list of those Vim
  plugins I cannot live without.
  
    # Netrw (From Vim 7.2 y 7.3, the most up to date
      versions, it is default)  It is the file browser. May
      be difficult at the beginning -for it is long and a
      little complicated- but it worths every penny of your
      time. It does even handle "transparently" files _on_
      _the net_, _the cloud_ or whatever the hype is right now.
      Which is to say, it handles network files as if they
      were in your own hard disk. Good luck with M$ Word!
      
    # Vimoutliner: The #1 outliner, (TODO lists and
      brainmaps) I don't use this anymore as it has been
      successfully replaced by the one following:
      
    # VimWiki: The #1 outliner! (this time is for real) It
      handles from calendar reminders to a personal wiki.
      Which you can put online with just a web server. Your
      own personal diary or outlining TODO lists as:
      
      * [o] My TODO
        * [X] Kill my neighbor
        * [ ] Take out the dog
        * [ ] Wash the bike
        * [ ] Finish monitoring program
        * [X] Kill the other neighbor
        * [X] Kill the wife of that neighbor
        * [ ] `URGENT`: there is something wrong with me!

      I liked much more VimOutliner because it defined
      completion percentages but you can see this one
      present us with `o` meaning 50% or `O` above 75%. `.`
      is for below 25% and so forth.
      
    # GetScript: Updates automagically most versions of your
      personal plugins.

    # TwitVim: Pleeeease!

    # Renamer: Rename your files from Vim. It is the most
      powerful mass renamer I've seen in action, and it is
      simple to the core. Once you get regex, this one is
      priceless.
      
    # Mark: Create usual marks but visually. I don't use it
      so much, but you may like it. Uninstall candidate.

    # MRU: By issuing `:MRU` in normal mode, it shows the
      last files you have used. You can move around names
      and then press `<ENTER>` to open one of them. However,
      Vim does something similar by default. Pressing
      `<CTRL+o>` open the last file in a sequence of the
      most recent ones.  I did in fact removed this plugin.
      Less is more..! `:ol[dfiles]` and `:files` do exactly
      the same (showing recent files or already open).

    # Speeddating: It does not get you "romantic dates" any
      "fast" but at least increments and decrements
      correctly the calendar dates you trow at it. For you
      see, *in normal mode* `<CTRL+a>` and `<CTRL+x>`
      *increase and decrease* numbers automatically. This
      plugin extends that functionality to dates. 

    # Info and Man: Convert Vim in a colorful and useful
      replacement for the command line programs `man` and
      `info`.

    # NERDCommenter: By pressing the sequence
      `<leader>c<Space>` in normal mode, it puts or removes
      source code comments automatically (toggle) whichever
      the programming language is.  It supports about 50
      different languages. Tcomment works similarly but I
      personally dislike it.
      
    # Gist: Uploads to gist (github's pastebin) the code in
      your current buffer.
      
    # Repeat: Enhances the repeat function (which I don't
      use so much) You know, by default, pressing `..` in
      normal mode, repeats the last action as much as you
      keep pressing `..` as much as you keep pressing `..`
      as much as you keep pressing `..` as much as you keep
      pressing `..` as much as you keep pressing `..` as
      much as you keep pressing `..` as much as you keep
      pressing `..` as much as you keep pressing `..`
      
      Got it now?
      
    # Calendar: Colorful and simple calendars to keep your
      daily notes through VimWiki!
      
    # Surround: A little complicated for beginners?  I don't
      know and I don't care either.  It is useful for
      anybody, adds new key combinations to change the
      surroundings of words, phrases and lines.  i.e.,
      "surroundings" may change to {{surroundings}}. by
      pressing cs{{ (change surround ...to {{) Yippee!
      
    # Tetris: Who can live without tetris? Don't you have a
      heart?

    # Mastermind: Who can live without mastermind? Are you
      in your right mind?

    # Matrix: Who can live without any cheesy "The Matrix"
      screensaver?
      
    # Mines: For the poor guys who didn't want to write a
      pacman clone for Vim.
    
    # snipMate: If you want to really work at light-speed
      when editing files, this one completes expressions as
      if it was an IDE. I created a new series of AWK
      command completions for this plugin in about 30
      minutes. Ruby support is exceptional. Many people
      writes completions for this one. HTML writes itself
      thanks to snip!

* Featured plugins:
    # Align: I reinstalled this command some time ago, it is
      a waste generally speaking and isn't easy to configure
      either. You will be good without it but you will
      appreciate it after getting the idea. It is kind of a
      code beautifier that aligns some characters (not so
      useful in Haskell and Python...)
    # NERDtree: Nice file browser which is nothing compared
      to Netrw, and isn't as easy to use in a daily basis;
      but it is more popular go figure out why.


==== Crazy Action Commands ====

* Do write whatever text and then issue `:TOhtml`. Vim will
  convert a temporal file of your code or text to html.
  If it is code you'll be surprised with the results
  (readily colorized for publication) Featuring your
  favorite theme colors (almost matching) and exact
  indentation for free and much better than online clipboard
  services. :)
  
* If you have installed tidy, Vim will will tidify (enhance
  the looks of) your HTML code.

* `:h 42` has all the answers.

* Bindings: Atributos para comandos de teclado o para
  asignar a una tecla o combinación de teclas el mismo valor
  que otra. Ej, `iabr WbY Written By: Mario García H.
  <http://keyjunkie.blogspot.com>` me cambia todo el
  contexto a Written By:... Cada vez que escribo WbY
  en modo de inserción (iabr: iNSERT-abreviate) dentro de
  ~/.vimrc. Aunque puedes crear abreviaturas temporales
  desde la línea de comandos de Vim.
  Otro ejemplo: `map <F2> :call MyTidy()` llama mi función
  personalizada MyTidy cada vez que presiono `<F2>`. Etc.
  Para más ayuda `:h :map`.
  
* Corrección ortográfica: El señalador `highlighter` de
  palabras incorrectas depende de tu téma de colores. Este
  te avisa en colores distintos si debería haber una
  mayúscula tras un punto o inicio de párrafo o una
  palabra mal escrita. De hecho, espero que esto esté
  bien escrito porque no estoy usando el corrector
  ortográfico :p
  
  Para activar la corrección:
  `:set spell spelllang=es` = lengua española.  Sí no
  funciona y vim se queja es porque, muy probablemente, no
  tienes los archivos de lenguaje instalados.
  
  Se resuelve de la siguiente manera:
  `mkdir -p ~/.vim/spell`
  `cd ~/.vim/spell`
  `wget http://ftp.roedu.net/pub/pub/packages/vim/unstable/runtime/spell/{es.latin1.sug,es.latin1.spl,en.latin1.sug,en.latin1.spl,es.utf-8.spl,es.utf-8.sug,en.utf-8.spl,en.utf-8.sug}`
  
  Posiblemente sobren los archivos *latin1* si tu entorno
  está configurado para *utf8*, que es lo predefinido y
  deseable en las distribuciones de sistemas operativos
  libres actuales.
  
  *Uso corrector ortográfico:* La combinación `z=` te
   muestra las palabras sugeridas, `zg` guarda palabras que
   creas bien escritas y el diccionario no conozca. El resto
   lo encuentras con: `:h spell`
  
* Convertidores: VimWiki convierte texto de manera casi
  automática. Pero hay muchos convertidores para Latex, etc.
  Incluso desde texto casi plano. ¡Yippie!
  
* Esqueletos: ¡Imperdible! Dentro de poco publicaré mi
  configuración personal. Ahí están mis esqueletos con
  derechos y licencias para escoger (beerware/GPL3/anticons)
  según lo que escribo y detalles sobre el programa.
  Con sólo poner en la terminal `$ vim nombre.sh` sale
  la cabecera completa y sin esfuerzo por mi parte.
  
  ¡Para eso inventaron las computadoras!
  
  *NOTA:* Por esqueletos me refiero a "templates",
  "plantillas" o modelos predefinidos de texto para
   determinados archivos.

-------------------------

Eso es todo lo que recuerdo por ahora en un orden que creo
medianamente adecuado.

Finalmente, te habrás dado cuenta de que este texto está
relativamente bien formateado para estar escrito en texto
plano. Eso se debe a la `magic` line que aparece más
abajo.  VimWiki le está dando formato por mí. Yo sólo
escribo mientras VimWiki se preocupa por la indentación y
la numeración. Cuando lo tengas instalado (si lo quieres)
verás este texto en colores, espero que así sea.

Bueno, te dejo con Vim. Creo que ya conoces el tutorial. Te
servirá de práctica en los momentos aciagos. Si no lo
conocías, teclea `vimtutor` en una terminal o dentro de Vim,
`:h tutor`.
